# monthlygroceryplanner

***(This application was developed as a project under CS-530 (Design of User Interfaces) course.)***

This web application allows users to keep a track of their monthly grocery shopping. It allows the user to create a monthly list of items. The user can also add bills of shopping trips. The system will then analyze which items the user missed during shopping, the monthly expense, which department the user spends his/her money on and other useful information.
